# Menu System Architecture

This directory contains the refactored menu system for the Automation Workflow component. The architecture follows object-oriented design principles with a focus on maintainability, extensibility, and separation of concerns.

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Strategy Pattern** - For menu positioning and display strategies
2. **Command Pattern** - For encapsulating menu actions
3. **Factory Pattern** - For creating appropriate menu instances
4. **Observer Pattern** - For event handling and propagation

## Core Components

1. **Menu Base Classes** - Abstract base classes and interfaces that define the menu system contract
2. **Menu Implementations** - Concrete menu implementations for different contexts
3. **Menu Manager** - Centralized menu state management
4. **Menu Positioning Strategies** - Strategies for positioning menus in different contexts
5. **Menu Commands** - Command objects for menu actions

## Extension Points

The menu system is designed to be easily extended:

1. Create new menu types by extending the `Menu` base class
2. Add new positioning strategies by implementing the `MenuPositioningStrategy` interface
3. Create new commands by implementing the `MenuCommand` interface
4. Register new menu types with the `MenuFactory`

## Integration with AutomationWorkflow

The refactored menu system is integrated with the main AutomationWorkflow component through the `MenuManager`, which serves as a facade to the entire menu subsystem.
