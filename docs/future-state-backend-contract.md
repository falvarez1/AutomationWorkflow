# Future State Workflow Backend API Contract

This document outlines the planned future enhancements to the API contract between the frontend workflow editor and the ASP.NET backend server.

## API Requirements and Considerations

### Performance Requirements

1. **Response Time**
   - API endpoints must respond within 500ms for read operations
   - Write operations must complete within 2 seconds
   - Real-time updates via SignalR must be delivered within 100ms

2. **Throughput**
   - Must support at least 100 concurrent workflow executions
   - Must handle 1000+ API requests per minute
   - Must support 500+ concurrent SignalR connections

3. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling for execution engine
   - Database sharding for large workflow repositories
   - Cache optimization for frequently accessed workflows

### Security Requirements

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication with refresh token flow
   - OAuth 2.0 integration for third-party clients
   - Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Resource-level permissions for workflows
   - Tenant isolation for multi-tenant deployments

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest for all workflow data
   - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
   - Sensitive value masking in logs and API responses

### Reliability Requirements

1. **Availability**
   - 99.9% uptime SLA for API services
   - Automatic failover for critical components
   - Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies

2. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error response format
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Rate limiting and backoff strategies

3. **Workflow Execution**
   - At-least-once execution guarantee
   - Idempotent node execution where possible
   - Execution state persistence for recovery

### Integration Requirements

1. **External Systems**
   - Standardized connector interface
   - Support for OAuth, API keys, and other auth methods
   - Connection pooling for improved performance

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Webhook support for external triggers
   - Event bus for inter-service communication
   - Dead letter queue for failed messages

3. **Data Exchange**
   - JSON Schema validation for all inputs/outputs
   - Support for large file transfers
   - Binary data handling for non-text content

## Backend Architecture

### Microservice Decomposition

The backend will be decomposed into these primary microservices:

1. **API Gateway**
   - Route API requests to appropriate services
   - Handle authentication and authorization
   - Implement rate limiting and request validation

2. **Workflow Management Service**
   - Create, update, and delete workflow definitions
   - Manage workflow versions and templates
   - Handle import/export functionality

3. **Workflow Execution Engine**
   - Execute workflow steps
   - Manage execution state and history
   - Scale horizontally for concurrent execution

4. **Node Type Registry**
   - Register and discover node types
   - Validate node configurations
   - Manage node type versions and compatibility

5. **User & Tenant Management**
   - Handle user authentication
   - Manage roles and permissions
   - Support multi-tenant isolation

6. **Analytics Service**
   - Collect execution metrics
   - Generate performance insights
   - Provide usage statistics

### Data Storage Strategy

1. **Workflow Definitions**
   - Document database (Cosmos DB)
   - Version control through event sourcing
   - Optimistic concurrency for collaborative editing

2. **Execution State**
   - Combination of relational database for queryability
   - Redis for active execution state
   - Blob storage for execution logs

3. **User & Permission Data**
   - Relational database with read replicas
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data

### Caching Strategy

1. **Multi-level Caching**
   - In-memory cache for hot data
   - Distributed cache (Redis) for shared data
   - CDN for static resources

2. **Cache Invalidation**
   - Time-based expiration for non-critical data
   - Event-based invalidation for workflow changes
   - Version tagging for cache entries

## Development and Operations

### API Versioning Strategy

1. **URL Path Versioning**
   - `/api/v1/workflows`, `/api/v2/workflows`
   - Major version changes for breaking changes
   - Maintain compatibility for at least one previous version

2. **Header-based Versioning (Alternative)**
   - Using `X-API-Version` header
   - Useful for granular versioning of specific endpoints

### Monitoring and Observability

1. **Telemetry Requirements**
   - Distributed tracing across all services
   - Detailed logging with correlation IDs
   - Real-time metrics dashboard

2. **Health Checks**
   - Endpoint health monitoring
   - Dependency health checks
   - Proactive alerting for anomalies

3. **Auditing**
   - Complete audit trail for all operations
   - User activity monitoring
   - Security event logging

### Deployment Model

1. **Container Orchestration**
   - Kubernetes-based deployment
   - Helm charts for service configuration
   - Horizontal pod autoscaling based on load

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing including API contract tests
   - Blue/green deployments
   - Canary releases for risk mitigation

3. **Environment Strategy**
   - Development, testing, staging, production environments
   - Data isolation between environments
   - Configuration management via environment variables

## Testing Requirements

1. **API Contract Testing**
   - Automated testing of API contracts
   - Schema validation for requests and responses
   - Performance benchmarking

2. **Load Testing**
   - Simulate peak load conditions
   - Measure response times under load
   - Identify bottlenecks and resource limits

3. **Security Testing**
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Code analysis for security issues

## Compliance and Governance

1. **Data Retention**
   - Configurable retention policies
   - Automated data archiving
   - Secure data deletion

2. **Privacy Compliance**
   - GDPR compliance controls
   - Data subject request handling
   - Personal data identification and classification

3. **Regulatory Requirements**
   - Audit logging for regulated industries
   - Compliance reporting capabilities
   - Support for data sovereignty requirements
